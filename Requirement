Of course. To run this application on your local machine, you'll need to set up a few things. Here is a breakdown of the requirements:
1. Hardware Requirements
Microphone: A functional microphone is essential for the voice chat feature.
2. Software and Environment
Modern Web Browser: You need an up-to-date browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge that supports:
Web Audio API (for microphone access and audio processing).
WebGL (for rendering the 3D visuals).
ES Modules with Import Maps (which this project uses to load libraries like lit and three).
Local Web Server: You cannot run this application by simply opening the index.html file in your browser (file://...). Browser security policies restrict microphone access and other features on local files. You must serve the project folder using a local web server.
If you have Node.js installed, you can open a terminal in the project directory and run npx serve.
If you have Python installed, you can run python3 -m http.server.
This will host your application on a local address like http://localhost:3000.
3. API Key Configuration
Google Gemini API Key: The application requires a valid API key to communicate with the Gemini models.
You can get a free key from Google AI Studio.
The code expects this key to be available as process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY. Since you are running this in a browser locally, process.env will not be defined. You will need to manually edit the index.tsx file and replace process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY with your actual API key string:
Generated javascript
// In index.tsx, find this line:
apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY,

// And change it to:
apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
Use code with caution.
JavaScript
Important: Be careful not to expose this key in public code repositories.
4. Build/Compilation (Handling the .tsx file)
The main application file is index.tsx, which is a TypeScript file. Browsers cannot execute TypeScript directly. The environment this app was designed for likely had an automatic compilation step.
To run it locally, you must convert this file to JavaScript.
Simple Method: Rename index.tsx to index.js. Then, open index.js and manually remove all the TypeScript type annotations (e.g., : string, : Session, : LiveServerMessage, etc.). The rest of the code is standard JavaScript that the browser can run.
Add Script to HTML: You will also need to add a script tag to your index.html file to load the JavaScript module. Add this line inside the <body> tag:
Generated html
<script type="module" src="./index.js"></script>
Use code with caution.
Html
In summary, the key steps are: get an API key, put it in the code, handle the TypeScript-to-JavaScript conversion, and run everything on a local web server.
